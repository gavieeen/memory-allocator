# Memory Allocator Project: Turbo Malloc Competition üèÜ  

This project was my entry into the **Turbo Malloc Contest**, a competitive programming challenge where over 250 students implemented custom memory allocators in C to outperform both peers and the **glibc malloc**. The goal was to achieve superior performance and efficiency across a variety of test cases while adhering to correctness requirements.

## üöÄ Project Overview  

I developed a custom memory allocator that implemented `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, and `free` from scratch. The allocator was designed to optimize memory usage, reduce fragmentation, and improve execution times. My implementation utilized **First Fit** and **Best Fit** allocation strategies, along with significant optimizations to metadata and free list management.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details  

### Allocation Strategies
I tested 2 strategies of which I found the first to ultimately be faster through testing:

1. **First Fit:**  
   - The allocator scanned the free list for the first block large enough to satisfy the allocation request.  
   - This strategy was simple and fast, making it ideal for smaller allocations or workloads with low fragmentation.  

2. **Best Fit:**  
   - The allocator searched for the smallest block that could satisfy the request, minimizing wasted space.  
   - While slightly slower than First Fit, this approach reduced external fragmentation over time.  

### Metadata Optimization  
One of the key innovations in my implementation was reducing metadata size from **52 bytes** to **24 bytes**. This was achieved by:  
- Removing unnecessary pointers like backward tags (`btag`) and redundant pointers in the free list structure.  
- Leveraging **address calculation** and pointer arithmetic to infer block sizes and relationships instead of storing explicit values.  

This optimization not only reduced overhead but also improved cache locality, leading to faster memory operations.

### Free List Management  
I implemented an **address-ordered free linked list**, which maintained free blocks in ascending order of their addresses. This allowed for:  
- Faster coalescing of adjacent free blocks during deallocation.  
- Improved performance in Best Fit searches due to predictable block ordering.

## üéØ Results  

### Performance Against glibc  
My allocator was tested against the standard library's glibc implementation across a variety of test cases, including small allocations, large allocations, and mixed workloads. The scoring formula rewarded implementations that minimized execution time and memory usage relative to glibc.

#### Key Achievements:  
- **Beating 250+ Students:** My allocator outperformed all other student implementations in both correctness and performance.  
- **Only One to Beat glibc Optimized Allocator:** I achieved a performance score **20% better than glibc**, making my implementation the only one to surpass its optimized version in the contest.

## üìä Contest Scoring Formula üí°  

The contest scoring formula evaluated both execution time and memory efficiency:  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cad2d41c-d08a-41f0-b121-982fb6252c2c)

Where:

- **n**: The number of tests.
- **reference** (in the subscript): Refers to the reference implementation (e.g., glibc).
- **student** (in the subscript): Refers to the student‚Äôs implementation.
- **time_reference,i**: The time the reference implementation spends on test `i`.
- **time_student,i**: The time the student‚Äôs implementation spends on test `i`.
- **avg_reference,i**: The average memory used by the reference implementation on test `i`.
- **avg_student,i**: The average memory used by the student‚Äôs implementation on test `i`.
- **max_reference,i**: The maximum memory used by the reference implementation on test `i`.
- **max_student,i**: The maximum memory used by the student‚Äôs implementation on test `i`. 

Higher scores indicated better performance relative to glibc.

## üìà Analysis of Success  

### Why My Allocator Outperformed glibc:  
1. **Efficient Metadata Design:** Reducing metadata size from 52 bytes to 24 bytes minimized overhead and improved cache locality.  
2. **Optimized Free List Management:** The address-ordered free linked list enabled faster coalescing and reduced fragmentation over time.  
3. **Balanced Allocation Strategies:** Combining First Fit and Best Fit approaches allowed my allocator to adapt effectively to different workloads.
